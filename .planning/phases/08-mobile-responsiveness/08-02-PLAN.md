<objective>
Optimize the Activity Swiper for mobile devices with responsive card heights, improved touch gestures, and mobile-specific enhancements.

Purpose: The swiper is a core feature for volunteers - it must work flawlessly on mobile where most users will interact with it.
Output: Responsive swiper that adapts to screen size with optimized touch interactions.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Make swiper card stack height responsive</name>
  <files>frontend/src/components/volunteer/ActivitySwiper.jsx, frontend/src/pages/Swiper.jsx</files>
  <action>
  Current issue: Card stack has fixed `h-[480px]` which may be too tall on small mobile screens or too short on larger screens.

  1. ActivitySwiper.jsx:
     - Change `h-[480px]` to responsive: `h-[400px] sm:h-[440px] md:h-[480px]`
     - This gives: 400px on phones, 440px on small tablets, 480px on desktop
     - Keeps cards visible while maximizing content area

  2. Swiper.jsx:
     - Update the page container to be more mobile-friendly
     - Change `py-8` to `py-4 sm:py-6 md:py-8` for tighter mobile spacing
     - Change heading `text-3xl` to `text-2xl sm:text-3xl` for smaller phones
     - Change `mb-8` to `mb-4 sm:mb-6 md:mb-8` on heading

  Ensure the swiper is usable on screens as small as 320px width.
  </action>
  <verify>Test swiper at 375px, 414px, 768px, 1024px widths - cards should fit without overflow</verify>
  <done>Card stack uses responsive heights, page has tighter mobile spacing</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Lower swipe threshold for easier mobile gestures</name>
  <files>frontend/src/components/volunteer/SwipeableCard.jsx</files>
  <action>
  Current `swipeConfidenceThreshold = 100` may be too high for one-handed phone use.

  1. Make threshold responsive to screen size:
     - Add a hook to detect mobile: can use window.innerWidth check or better, use the drag offset proportionally
     - Simpler approach: Lower threshold to 80 which works better for both
     - Change `const swipeConfidenceThreshold = 100` to `const swipeConfidenceThreshold = 80`

  2. Increase drag elasticity slightly for more responsive feel:
     - `dragElastic={1}` is already good, keep as-is

  3. Make the swipe indicators more visible on mobile:
     - PASS/MATCH labels: Change `top-8 left-8` to `top-4 left-4 sm:top-8 sm:left-8`
     - And `top-8 right-8` to `top-4 right-4 sm:top-8 sm:right-8`
     - Change `px-6 py-2 text-xl` to `px-4 py-1.5 text-lg sm:px-6 sm:py-2 sm:text-xl`

  Test that swipe feels natural with thumb on mobile device.
  </action>
  <verify>Swipe gesture triggers at ~80px drag, indicators are visible on small screens</verify>
  <done>Lower swipe threshold (80px), mobile-optimized indicator positioning and sizing</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Optimize ActivityCard content for mobile viewport</name>
  <files>frontend/src/components/activities/ActivityCard.jsx</files>
  <action>
  The ActivityCard is used inside the swiper and needs to display well at various heights.

  1. Make text sizing responsive:
     - Title: Change `text-xl` to `text-lg sm:text-xl` for slightly smaller mobile title
     - Description `line-clamp-2` is good, keep it

  2. Make the metadata section more compact on mobile:
     - Change `space-y-2` to `space-y-1.5 sm:space-y-2` for tighter mobile spacing
     - Icon sizes are fine at `w-4 h-4`

  3. Make capacity section responsive:
     - Change `mt-4 pt-4` to `mt-3 pt-3 sm:mt-4 sm:pt-4` for tighter mobile spacing

  4. Make TTS section responsive:
     - Change `mt-4 pt-4` to `mt-3 pt-3 sm:mt-4 sm:pt-4`

  Keep the card readable but more compact on mobile to fit more content in the swiper view.
  </action>
  <verify>ActivityCard renders well in swiper at 375px width, all content visible</verify>
  <done>ActivityCard has responsive text sizing and spacing optimized for mobile</done>
