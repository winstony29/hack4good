<objective>
Ensure all interactive elements have touch-friendly tap targets (minimum 44px) and adequate spacing for mobile use.

Purpose: Accessibility and usability on touch devices - users should easily tap buttons, links, and form controls without accidental mis-taps.
Output: Updated Button, Input, SwipeButtons, and link components with mobile-optimized touch targets.

**Tech available:** Tailwind CSS responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:)
**Established patterns:** min-h-[44px] already on Button component

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Audit and fix touch target sizes</name>
  <files>frontend/src/components/shared/Button.jsx, frontend/src/components/volunteer/SwipeButtons.jsx</files>
  <action>
  1. Button.jsx: The small/sm size variant uses `px-3 py-1.5` which results in ~36px height. Add responsive sizing: on mobile (default) use minimum 44px height, on md+ screens can use smaller sizes. Change sizes object:
     - sm/small: `px-3 py-2 text-sm min-h-[44px] md:min-h-0 md:py-1.5`
     - Ensure all button variants maintain 44px minimum on mobile

  2. SwipeButtons.jsx: Current 64px (w-16 h-16) is great for mobile. Add responsive sizing to make buttons even larger on mobile for easier touch: `w-16 h-16 sm:w-14 sm:h-14` (64px mobile, 56px desktop - desktop can be smaller since using mouse). Actually current 64px is fine, leave as-is.

  Do NOT change medium/large button sizes - they already meet 44px minimum.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run lint passes, Button component renders correctly at all sizes</verify>
  <done>Small buttons have 44px minimum height on mobile, desktop can use original smaller size</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add touch-friendly spacing to mobile navigation links</name>
  <files>frontend/src/components/layout/Navbar.jsx</files>
  <action>
  The mobile menu links are currently plain text links with no vertical padding, making them hard to tap.

  1. Update mobile navigation links (inside `mobileMenuOpen && ...` block) to have touch-friendly sizing:
     - Add `py-3` (12px vertical padding) to each Link component for larger tap area
     - Add `block w-full` to make entire row tappable
     - The links should be: `block w-full py-3 text-gray-700 hover:text-primary-600 transition-colors`

  2. Increase gap between mobile nav items from `gap-4` to `gap-2` since the padding now handles spacing.

  Do NOT modify desktop navigation - it uses hover states which work differently.
  </action>
  <verify>Visually inspect mobile menu - links should have comfortable tap areas (at least 44px height each)</verify>
  <done>Mobile nav links have py-3 padding creating ~48px tap targets, full-width tappable area</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Ensure form inputs have adequate touch sizing</name>
  <files>frontend/src/components/shared/Input.jsx, frontend/src/components/auth/AuthForm.jsx</files>
  <action>
  1. Input.jsx: Current input has `py-2` which gives ~40px height. Increase to `py-3` on mobile for better touch targets:
     - Change `py-2` to `py-3 md:py-2` - 48px on mobile, 40px on desktop
     - Ensure the focus ring is visible: already has `focus:ring-2`

  2. AuthForm.jsx: The select dropdowns also need touch-friendly sizing:
     - Change `py-2` to `py-3 md:py-2` on both select elements (role and membership_type selects)
     - These use inline styles - update the className to include mobile-friendly padding

  Do NOT change the label sizing or spacing between form fields.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run lint passes, form inputs are comfortable to tap on mobile (48px height minimum)</verify>
  <done>Form inputs and selects have 48px height on mobile, 40px on tablet/desktop</done>
</task>
