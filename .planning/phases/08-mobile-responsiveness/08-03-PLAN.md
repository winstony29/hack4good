<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Optimize Landing page for mobile</name>
  <files>frontend/src/pages/Landing.jsx</files>
  <action>
  1. Hero section responsive improvements:
     - Title: Change `text-5xl md:text-6xl` to `text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl`
     - Subtitle: Change `text-xl` to `text-lg sm:text-xl`
     - Container: Change `py-20` to `py-12 sm:py-16 md:py-20`

  2. CTA buttons - make stack vertically on very small screens:
     - Change `flex gap-4 justify-center` to `flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-3 sm:gap-4 justify-center items-center`
     - This stacks buttons on phones <640px

  3. Feature cards grid - already has responsive classes, but can improve:
     - Change `mt-20 grid md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-8` to:
     - `mt-12 sm:mt-16 md:mt-20 grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4 sm:gap-6 md:gap-8`
     - This adds sm:grid-cols-2 so features show 2-up on small tablets

  4. FeatureCard component - make more compact on mobile:
     - Change `p-6` to `p-4 sm:p-6`
     - Change icon `mb-4` to `mb-3 sm:mb-4`
     - Change title `text-xl` to `text-lg sm:text-xl`

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Make Modal component mobile-friendly</name>
  <files>frontend/src/components/shared/Modal.jsx</files>
  <action>
  Modals need to work well on small screens without horizontal scrolling.

  1. Read the current Modal.jsx file first to understand its structure.

  2. Update modal container to be full-width on mobile:
     - The inner content div should have responsive width:
     - Change any fixed width (like `max-w-md` or `max-w-lg`) to include mobile-first:
     - Use `w-full max-w-md sm:max-w-lg` pattern or similar
     - Add `mx-4 sm:mx-auto` for mobile edge padding

  3. Add responsive padding to modal content:
     - If using `p-6` change to `p-4 sm:p-6`

  4. Ensure modal is scrollable on mobile if content is tall:
     - Add `max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto` to content container

  Modal should feel native on mobile - full width with small margins.
  </action>
  <verify>Open a modal on 375px viewport - should fit with margins, content scrollable if tall</verify>
  <done>Modal is full-width on mobile with proper padding and scrolling</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Improve ActivityCalendar filter buttons for mobile</name>
  <files>frontend/src/components/activities/ActivityCalendar.jsx</files>
  <action>
  The date filter buttons (Upcoming, This Week, This Month, All) can overflow on small screens.

  1. Make filter buttons wrap on mobile:
     - Change `flex gap-2` on date filters to `flex flex-wrap gap-2`
     - This allows buttons to wrap to second row on narrow screens

  2. Make view mode toggle (List/Grid) stay on same row as filters on desktop:
     - The current `flex-col sm:flex-row` is good, keep it
     - Ensure `items-start sm:items-center` for proper alignment

  3. Reduce button padding on mobile for filter buttons:
     - The buttons use size="sm" from Button component, which after our 08-01 changes will be 44px on mobile
     - This is fine, the wrapping handles overflow

  4. Make the sticky date headers work better:
     - Change `sticky top-0` to `sticky top-0 -mx-4 px-4` to extend to container edges
     - Add `bg-gray-50` fallback: the bg-white is fine but ensure it matches Layout bg
  </action>
  <verify>ActivityCalendar filter buttons wrap gracefully on 375px width, no horizontal scroll</verify>
  <done>Filter buttons wrap on mobile, view controls properly aligned</done>

  <what-built>Mobile responsive layouts across Landing page, Modal, and ActivityCalendar</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run: npm run dev (in frontend directory)
    2. Open browser DevTools, toggle device toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M / Cmd+Shift+M)
    3. Test at these viewports:
       - 320px (small phone)
       - 375px (iPhone SE)
       - 414px (iPhone Plus)
       - 768px (tablet)
       - 1024px (desktop)
    4. On Landing page:
       - Hero text should scale appropriately
       - CTA buttons should stack on phones, row on tablets+
       - Feature cards should be 1-col on phones, 2-col on tablets, 4-col on desktop
    5. Open any modal (e.g., Accessibility settings from navbar):
       - Should be nearly full-width on mobile with small margins
       - Content should be scrollable if tall
    6. Visit /activities page:
       - Filter buttons should wrap to second row if needed on small screens
       - No horizontal scrolling at any viewport
    7. Visit /swiper page:
       - Cards should fit comfortably at all sizes
       - Swipe gestures should feel responsive
